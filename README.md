## TG Drive's Bot Mode

TG Drive's Bot Mode is a new feature that allows you to upload files directly to your TG Drive website from a Telegram bot. Simply send or forward any file to the bot, and it will be uploaded to your TG Drive. You can also specify the folder where you want the files to be uploaded.

To use this feature, you need to set the configuration variables `MAIN_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_IDS`. More information about these variables can be found in the [optional variables section](#optional-variables).

Once these variables are set, users whose IDs are listed in `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_IDS` will have access to the bot.

### Bot Commands

- `/set_folder` - Set the folder for file uploads
- `/current_folder` - Check the current folder

### Quick Demo

#### Changing Folder for Uploading
